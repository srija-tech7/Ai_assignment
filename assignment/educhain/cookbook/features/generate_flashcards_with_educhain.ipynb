The client has $350,000 in assets (home, investments, cash) and $150,000 in liabilities (mortgage, car loan, credit card debt).

If they have $2,500 in monthly debt payments (existing mortgage, car loan, student loans, credit cards) and a gross monthly income of $8,000, their DTI is 31.25%. Most lenders prefer a DTI below 36%, so this client is in an acceptable range for loan approval.\"},{\"front\":\"What is the difference between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA?\",\"back\":\"Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible now but taxable when withdrawn during retirement. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.\",\"explanation\":\"When advising a 35-year-old client in the 24% tax bracket who expects to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, you might recommend a Roth IRA. Though they won\\'t get a tax deduction now, they\\'ll benefit from tax-free withdrawals during retirement when their tax rate is higher, potentially saving thousands in taxes over their lifetime.\"},{\"front\":\"What is the emergency fund formula recommended by most financial planners?\",\"back\":\"An emergency fund should contain 3-6 months of essential living expenses kept in a liquid, easily accessible account.\",\"explanation\":\"When creating a financial plan for a client with monthly essential expenses of $4,000, you would recommend an emergency fund of $12,000-$24,000.
